-Description
-What is DnaKey?
    -DnaKey (Decoding-Numerical-Alphabet-key) is an intelligent program, 
    designed to simplify the process of using complex passwords. 
-What DnaKey can do?
    -Unlike traditional password generators, 
    DnaKey uses a unique algorithm that does not rely on randomization, 
    resulting in a consistent and secure password every time. 
-How DnaKey do it?
    -The program incorporates an advanced neural network with over 60 neurons, 
    which enables it to decode complex password patterns 
    and create a robust password that is difficult to crack.
-Neural network capabilities?
     -In addition to its neural network capabilities, 
     DnaKey also has the ability to generate new, 
     unique passwords if given more than six characters.

-In summary, DnaKey is a powerful tool that takes the hassle out of password management, 
providing a simple and effective solution for keeping your online accounts safe and secure.
